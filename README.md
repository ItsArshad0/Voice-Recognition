🗣️ Speech Recognition and Language Translation 🎙️🌍
This is a Speech-to-Text and Language Translation project built using Python. It captures audio from the microphone, converts it into text, translates the text into a desired language, and finally uses text-to-speech (TTS) to speak the translated text.

✅ Features
🎙️ Speech Recognition: Captures your voice in English or any other language.
🌍 Language Translation: Translates your speech into any language like English, Hindi, French, etc.
🗣️ Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts the translated text into speech output.
💯 Real-time Processing: Fast and accurate conversion from speech to translated voice.
📜 How It Works
🎤 Speak in your native language (Tamil).
💬 The program will capture your voice and convert it into text.
🌐 It will then translate the text into your desired language (e.g., English, Hindi, French, etc.).
🔊 Finally, it will speak out the translated text using Python's pyttsx3 text-to-speech engine.
